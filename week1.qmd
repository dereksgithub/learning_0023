# Week 1 Introduction to Remote Sensing {.unnumbered}

## Overview

For the first week, we are introduced to the concept of remote sensing and how to download data and images collected by satellites and perform basic analysis with SNAP and R.

Remote sensing is part of GIS but it involves more than just GIS.

## Spectral Analysis

## Case Study of Bristol

For this practical, I picked Bristol as its distinct urban and suburb area split. The data is downloaded from [EU Copernicus Data Portal](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) and [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov).

First, I performed a scatter analysis for the greater Bristol area that I have picked for the analysis, this includes a large portion of suburb land, which indicates high biomass in the analysis.

Later on, I performed the down sampling for Sentinel-2A images to align its resolution with Landsat images.

## Results

After down-sampling Sentinel images and cross-analyzing it with LandSat of the POI, downtown area of Bristol, the result is recorded below, indicating high urban.

## Reflections

Remote sensing is certainly more than what I have previously pictured, which involves mainly a great deal of image processing. On the contrary, it consists of a balanced amount of geophysics, actual physics, and last but not least geography. [@navalgund2007remote] In short, it is an interdisciplinary realm comprised of decades of studies and applications. While traditional image processing or computer vision certainly plays an important role, [@wilkinson1999recent] further development in remote sensing certainly will demand a deep understanding of GIS, atmospheric science, spectral analysis, environmental science, ecology, and sensor technology etc.

Aside from the metaphysical overview of remote sensing as an interesting area of research, I further browsed around [EU Copernicus Data Portal](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) and [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov) to see what data I can have access for future research uses within and beyond the module.
