    "text": "Hi, welcome to my CASA0023 Learning Diary. A bit about myself:\nI am an engineer by training. Graduated from University of Alberta in 2015 with a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering. Been working in the ITS industry since. I’ve also got a Master of Information Technology from Monash University in 2019. Working as a graduate engineer in Melbourne for a few years and then product/solutions manager in the autonomous driving and smart cities industry.\nI am interested in transportation and urban evolution mostly. My career will be focusing on urban mobility and smart transportation from this degree on.\nBesides working on transportation challenges, I like to imagine how technology will evolve with us, humanity, into the future. Read and watched quite a few science fictions and learning about random subjects. For example, I was into hand-made Corsi-Rosenthal boxes during 2021 and 2022. I also likes to code. Here is the link to my side projects hosted on github:"

On the contrary, it consists of a health amount of geophysics, actual physics, and last but not least geography. In short, it is an interdisciplinary realm comprised of decades of studies and applications."
