Been working in the ITS industry since. I’ve also got a Master of Information Technology from Monash University in 2019. Working as a graduate engineer in Melbourne for a few years and then product/solutions manager in the autonomous driving and smart cities industry.\nI am interested in transportation and urban evolution mostly. My career will be focusing on urban mobility and smart transportation from this degree on.\nBesides working on transportation challenges, I like to imagine how technology will evolve with us, humanity, into the future. Read and watched quite a few science fictions and learning about random subjects. For example, I was into hand-made Corsi-Rosenthal boxes during 2021 and 2022.\n\n\n\nMy Hand-made Portable CR-Box (HEPA-13 + Active charcoal Filter)\n\n\nI also likes to code.

    "text": "Reflection\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a remote sensing index that measures the health and density of vegetation on the Earth’s surface. NIR represents the near-infrared light reflected by vegetation, and RED represents the visible red light reflected by vegetation.\n\\(NDVI = \\frac{(NIR - RED)}{(NIR+RED)}\\)\nAside from the NDVI, here are some other indicators that I have investigated and sumarized:\n\nARVI (Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index) is commonly employed to tackle regions of high atmospheric aerosol content. It was originally proposed for remote sensing of EOS MODIS sensor. (Kaufman and Tanre 1992) The range for an ARVI is -1 to 1 where green vegetation generally falls between values of 0.20 to 0.80.\n\n\\(ARVI = \\frac{(NIR - RED - y * (RED - BLUE))}{(NIR + RED - y*(RED-BLUE))}\\)\nAccording to ArcGIS: “ARVI is a vegetation-based index that minimizes the effects of atmospheric scattering caused by rain, fog, dust, smoke, or air pollution.”\ny is a constant to correct for the atmospheric effects caused by aerosol scattering in red channel.\n\nNDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) helps monitoring and mapping water content in soil and vegetation. (Wilson and Sader 2002) It is calculated as Near-Infrared’s and Short-Wave Infrared’s difference over sum.:\n\\(NDMI = \\frac{NIR - SWIR}{NIR + SWIR}\\)\n\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(NDMI =\\frac{(Band5 - Band6)}{(Band5+Band6)}​\\)\n\nSAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) is originally constructed to minimize soil brightness influences on NDVI, especially useful in areas with sparse vegetation. (AR Huete 1988)\n\n\\(SAVI =\\frac{(NIR+Red+L)}{(NIR−Red)}​∗(1+L)\\)\nSAVI introduces a soil brightness correction factor (L) to adjust the NDVI calculation, making it more accurate in sparse vegetation areas.\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(SAVI - \\frac{Band5 - Band4}{Band5 + Band4 +0.5}\\)\n\nMSAVI (Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) is an adjustment of SAVI, designed to minimize bare soil background effects more effectively and optimize vegetation monitoring. (Qi et al. 1994)\n\n\\(MSAVI = \\frac{2*NIR + 1 - \\sqrt{(2*NIR+1)-8*(NIR-RED)}}{2}\\)\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(SAVI - \\frac{2*Band5 + 1 - \\sqrt{(Band5+1)^2 -8*(Band5-Band4)}}{2}\\)\n\nGNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) focuses on chlorophyll content, primarily on the green spectral region for enahnced sensitivity to vegetation density. (Gitelson, Kaufman, and Merzlyak 1996)\n\n$ GNDVI = $\nLandsat 8-9: \\(NDMI =\\frac{Band5 - Band3}{Band5 + Band3}\\)\n\nEVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) was proposed to improve the sensitivity in high biomass regions and improves vegetation monitoring through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmospheric influences. (Alfredo Huete et al. 2002)\n\n\\(EVI=G \\frac{(NIR−Red)}{(NIR+C1⋅Red−C2⋅Blue+L)}\\)\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(EVI = 2.5 * \\frac{Band5 - Band4}{Band5 + 6* Band4 - 7.5*Band2 + 1}\\)\n\nNDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) was formulated for the detection of liquid water and moisture content of vegetation and soil.(Gao 1996)\n\n\\(NDWI_{veg​}= \\frac{(NIR+Green)}{(NIR−Green)}\\)\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(NDWI = \\frac{Band4-Band2}{Band4+band2}\\)\n\n\nThese indicators, are sufficient only for basic analysis demands, to dderive more hidden relations, more modern techniques such as deep learning,(Ma et al. 2019) and Semi-supervised representation learning (Yan et al. 2020) can also be employed. As for the technical part for this week’s practical, coding part is smooth, however the data collection and alignment do require a high level of dedication to get right at first run.\n\n\n\n\nGao, Bo-Cai. 1996. “NDWI—a Normalized Difference Water Index for Remote Sensing of Vegetation Liquid Water from Space.” Remote Sensing of Environment 58 (3): 257–66.\n\n\nGitelson, Anatoly A, Yoram J Kaufman, and Mark N Merzlyak. 1996. “Use of a Green Channel in Remote Sensing of Global Vegetation from EOS-MODIS.” Remote Sensing of Environment 58 (3): 289–98.\n\n\nHuete, Alfredo, Kamel Didan, Tomoaki Miura, E Patricia Rodriguez, Xiang Gao, and Laerte G Ferreira. 2002. “Overview of the Radiometric and Biophysical Performance of the MODIS Vegetation Indices.” Remote Sensing of Environment 83 (1-2): 195–213.\n\n\nHuete, AR. 1988. “A Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI).
