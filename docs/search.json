    "text": "Hi, welcome to my CASA0023 Learning Diary. I’ll be using this website built with Quarto as my major recording system for weekly practicals and writings. This could not be possible without our amazing lecturer Dr. Maclachlan, our amazing PGTAs (Postgraduate Teaching Assisstants) and additional GEE support from Dr. Ballinger.\nMy name is Mengyu Ding, I am an engineer by training. Graduated from University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, in 2015 with a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering. Afterwards, I have been lucky to work in the ITS(Intelligent Transportation Systems) and engineering consulting industry for many years. I’ve also got a Master of Information Technology from Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, in 2019. After my first master’s degree, I have been working as a graduate engineer for John Holland Group in Melbourne for a few years and then moved back to China to work to join a few interesting start-ups and scale-ups as product/solutions manager in the autonomous driving (V2X side) and smart cities industry. Career-wise, I am interested in transportation and smart cities mostly. I attend UCL to gear my career towards urban mobility and smart cities. The support and learning at UCL has been quite great. (and of course, sometimes sleep-depriving)\n\n\n\nGIS Crew and I (in the middle) Surveying Hu-Hang-Yong Highway in Zhejiang Province for Installing RSUs (Road Side Units)\n\n\nBesides working, I like hiking, cooking and reading science literature or science fictions. I also enjoy building small gadgets, for example, I was into hand-made Corsi-Rosenthal boxes during 2021 and 2022.\n\n\n\nMy Hand-made Portable CR-Box (HEPA-13 + Active charcoal Filter)"

Among these measures, NDVI as is widely used for monitoring urban vegetation and urban green space,(Xue, Su, et al. 2017) whereas NDWI plays a critical role in urban water body and drought monitoring, it is also important for urban fire prevention.(Zhu 2017) Other metrics, such as ARVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI, and NDMI are still relevant in the industry and contemporary urban science, but recent studies call for both enhancement of the indices and nuanced applications. As suggested in many publications, such correction methods can be further refined to optimized the data contamination brought by atmospheric or other factors. Zhou et al. (2021) proposed the use of HANTS model (Harmonic Analysis of Time Series) to further optimize the parameter settings for NDVI reconstruction at a global scale and over longer period of time.

    "text": "Reflection\nThe exploration of policy and global agenda, combined with the review of current literature, made this week’s class and practical a proper warm-up for the group assessment. I have also combed through the literature and policy base briefly, to further analyze the interplay between remote sensing, policy and air quality.\nEarly in the 2000s, studies have proposed the potentials of incorporating remote sesing into the air quality policy frameworks. (Veefkind et al. 2007) Aside from the potential of forecasting emergency air pollution caused by wildfires or other incidents, recent literature has also indicated the transformative potential of remote sensing in air quality monitoring.(Sokhi et al. 2022) Other researchers has highlighted the application of remote sensing for timely data on aerosol pollutants. (Gupta et al. 2006) therefore, the integration of remote sensing air quality monitoring, could also contribute to the approximate verification and robust back-up for ground air quality data collection. (Bechle, Millet, and Marshall 2013) To generalize the impact of urban air quality monitoring with remote sensing, researchers also suggested that remote sensing can be incorporated in the long-term exposure assessment of air pollutants (Van Donkelaar et al. 2015) and be utilized to discover hidden air pollution patterns. (Verma et al. 2023) Although the current policy frameworks around the world are including satellite images into air quality monitoring, the spatial and temporal resolution of such observation data could be further improved, offering policy makers and environmental agencies more detailed and timely knowledge on the air quality. Potential research directions could explore finer pollution detection,(Huang et al. 2022) establishing near real-time or real time data acquisitions,(Geng et al. 2021) compatibility or fusion with other key environmental metrics monitoring systems. (Prados et al. 2010) and a more hybrid approached in terms of acquiring air quality data such as combining the satellite observations with UAV images. (Budde et al. 2017)\nThe implications of such research are profound for policy-making, it can even contribute to a more data-driven paradigm shift as the data-driven planning. By leveraging remote sensing data, policymakers can benefit from timely and accurate information on the hazardous smoke plumes, their potential movement patterns and impact on overall urban air quality. From the test use of Sentinel 5P data shown above, we can conclude that the resolution overall is inadequate for predicting the movement of the pollutant clusters in the air. In addition, the remote sensing detection and forecasting, ought to be a value-addition or redundant measure to existing air quality measurement and monitoring frameworks and policy instruments. It is also obvious that integrating remote sensing data with real-time sensor data or other air quality monitoring data can pose technique challenges.\nIn summary, the exploration of air quality monitoring, policy interventions, and remote sensing, opens up a new realm of environmental protection and policy implementation. It exemplifies the innovation synergy between technology and policy by introducing remote sensing data analysis to both local and global environmental strategies."

    "text": "Wildfire Monitoring for Air Quality with Remote Sensing\n\nCase Study and Policy Implications for the Greater Melbourne Area\nThe goal for this short study is to explore the forecasting of smoke plume bush-fire to areas that may impact the residents and discuss policy implications. Focusing on Melbourne, with framework that includes remote sensing, intended to be integrated with sustainable future planning inspired the use of remote sensing for monitoring urban growth in Perth, WA. (MacLachlan et al. 2017)\nAs for the imagery, Sentinel 5P from Copernicus Program is offering sufficient resolutions. In terms of spatial resolution it covers up to a 5.5km x 3.5km area, Sentinel 5P also offers a daily global coverage, (revisits less than one day) providing enough temporal resolution. As for spectral resolution, Sentinel 5P offers accurate quantification of various atmospheric gases and pollutants including carbon monoxide(CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone(O3), formaldehyde(HCHO), sulfur dioxide(SO2), methane(CH4) and aerosols thanks to its extensive spectral coverage which includes UV, VIS and NIR bands.(Victoria 2019) It also possesses radiometric resolution at satisfactory level which enables the sensors on-board to distinguish different levels of signal intensity. The following is a video summary of the 2019 to 2020 bushfire air pollutant spread in Australia which resulted in low AQI in a great portion of the country’s residential areas not to mention destruction of many homes. (Tiernan and O’Mallon 2020)\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing the Sentinel 5P data(Trinder and Liu 2020), this proposed project aligns with the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribution (by Implementing Proposed Research/Development)\nSDG\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nContribute to the prevention of human respiratory damage caused by smogs from burning forest.\nUN SDG 3\nGood Health and Well-being, ensure people lives a healthy environment, promote well-being for all ages.\n\n\nProper monitoring and timely alerts, contributes to the enhancement of the built environment and overall community safety.\nUN SDG 11\nSustainable, resilient, inclusive and safe cities/communities.\n\n\nActively monitoring wild fires and smogs produced can offer insights and guidance for mitigation.\nUN SDG 13\nTake urgent actions against climate change.\n\n\nThis proposal can contribute to the sustainable of land resources and terrestrial ecosystems.\nUN SDG 15\nSustainable management of land, forests and biodiversity.\n\n\n\nNASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) can also be integrated into the workflow. Using remote sensing for monitoring wild fire monitoring has long been proposed for Eastern Australia. (Milne 1986)\nBy extracting values from the daily Sentinel 5p data, we can monitor the wildfire and combine the ground weather/air quality monitoring data, to determine how the polluted air will impact the densely populated area (mapping the air monitoring data over the building footprint in Australia) thus, provide intervention implications for distributing devices and masks. In the literature, similar was workflow proposed for monitoring wild fires in the US. (Kochanski et al. 2021)\n\n\n\nSentinel 5P, Feb 01 to Feb 06, 2020, NO2 level Around Melbourne\n\n\nAs in many regions of the world, residential AQI can be dramatically affected by wildfires, therefore, it is crucial to have a integrated pipeline for the monitoring of harmful aerosol spike which is also incorporated into the policy stack and is dedicated with ample resources.\n\n\n\nSentinel 5P image Overlay with Map around (well, again, “around” and covering VIC and NSW) Melbourne (Time window set to December 01, 2019 to February 06, 2020)\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Policy Stack and Wofkflow\nAs a vibrant metropolis in the state of Victoria, the local councils and state government around the Greater Melbourne Area, has implemented air quality policies aimed at safeguarding the health and well-being of their residents.\n\n\n\nProposed Workflow Serving as an Add-on to the Current Government Workflow and Policy Stack\n\n\n\nEnvironment Protection Amendment Act 2018: This act introduces a general environmental duty that requires proactive risk management to prevent harm to public health and the environment, including air quality impacts.\nEPA Victoria’s AirWatch: A platform that offers real-time air quality information to the public, including an AQI that categorizes air quality levels and provides health advisories, enabling residents to make informed decisions about outdoor activities.\n\n\n\nProposed Mitigation\nIn light of this,this proposal aims to integrate state-of-art remote sensing technology into Melbourne’s current air quality management workflow, offering a multifaceted approach to mitigate air pollution risks:\n\nEstablishment of High-Frequency Sentinel Points: By setting up strategically positioned sentinel points equipped with remote sensing capabilities, we propose to advance the forecasting of Points of Interest (POIs) for early air quality alerts. This system will enable the detection of potential air quality deterioration before polluted air approaches the residential vicinity, allowing for proactive measures to be taken.\nDeployment of Air Filtration and Respiratory Device Stations: Recognizing the immediate health impacts of poor air quality, we plan to establish stations across key urban and suburban locations for the distribution of air filtering and respiratory devices. These stations will ensure that citizens have timely access to necessary protective equipment against smoke and pollutants. Ideally, the station can be established inside local hospitals or clinics.\nEnhanced Emergency Evacuation Planning: Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) methods alongside satellite imagery analysis will be employed to refine emergency evacuation planning. By identifying optimal evacuation routes and safe zones in advance, the updated workflow will facilitate efficient relocation strategies during smoky conditions, ensuring public safety and minimizing chaos.\n\n\n\nImplementation and Emergency Planning Techniques\nOur methodology leverages state-of-the-art remote sensing technology, including the analysis of satellite data from platforms such as Sentinel-5P, to offer unparalleled insights into air quality dynamics. The integration of ABM methods will further enhance our predictive capabilities, allowing for the simulation of various scenarios and the formulation of robust emergency response strategies.\n\n\nConclusion\nBy integrating advanced remote sensing technology into the city’s existing workflow, we aim not only to protect the well-being of Melbourne’s citizens but also to set a new standard for urban air quality management worldwide."

    "text": "Summary of Indices\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a remote sensing index that measures the health and density of vegetation on the Earth’s surface. NIR represents the near-infrared light reflected by vegetation, and RED represents the visible red light reflected by vegetation.\n\\(NDVI = \\frac{(NIR - RED)}{(NIR+RED)}\\)\nAside from the NDVI, here are some other indicators that I have investigated and summarized:\n\nARVI (Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index) is commonly employed to tackle regions of high atmospheric aerosol content. It was originally proposed for remote sensing of EOS MODIS sensor. (Kaufman and Tanre 1992) The range for an ARVI is -1 to 1 where green vegetation generally falls between values of 0.20 to 0.80.\n\n\\(ARVI = \\frac{(NIR - RED - y * (RED - BLUE))}{(NIR + RED - y*(RED-BLUE))}\\)\nAccording to ArcGIS: “ARVI is a vegetation-based index that minimizes the effects of atmospheric scattering caused by rain, fog, dust, smoke, or air pollution.”\ny is a constant to correct for the atmospheric effects caused by aerosol scattering in red channel.\n\nNDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) helps monitoring and mapping water content in soil and vegetation. (Wilson and Sader 2002) It is calculated as Near-Infrared’s and Short-Wave Infrared’s difference over sum.:\n\\(NDMI = \\frac{NIR - SWIR}{NIR + SWIR}\\)\n\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(NDMI =\\frac{(Band5 - Band6)}{(Band5+Band6)}​\\)\n\nSAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) is originally constructed to minimize soil brightness influences on NDVI, especially useful in areas with sparse vegetation. (AR Huete 1988)\n\n\\(SAVI =\\frac{(NIR+Red+L)}{(NIR−Red)}​∗(1+L)\\)\nSAVI introduces a soil brightness correction factor (L) to adjust the NDVI calculation, making it more accurate in sparse vegetation areas.\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(SAVI - \\frac{Band5 - Band4}{Band5 + Band4 +0.5}\\)\n\nMSAVI (Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) is an adjustment of SAVI, designed to minimize bare soil background effects more effectively and optimize vegetation monitoring. (Qi et al. 1994)\n\n\\(MSAVI = \\frac{2*NIR + 1 - \\sqrt{(2*NIR+1)-8*(NIR-RED)}}{2}\\)\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(SAVI - \\frac{2*Band5 + 1 - \\sqrt{(Band5+1)^2 -8*(Band5-Band4)}}{2}\\)\n\nGNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) focuses on chlorophyll content, primarily on the green spectral region for enhanced sensitivity to vegetation density. (Gitelson, Kaufman, and Merzlyak 1996)\n\n\\[NDVI = \\frac{NIR - Green}{NIR +Green}\\]\nLandsat 8-9: \\(NDMI =\\frac{Band5 - Band3}{Band5 + Band3}\\)\n\nEVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) was proposed to improve the sensitivity in high biomass regions and improves vegetation monitoring through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmospheric influences. (Alfredo Huete et al. 2002)\n\n\\(EVI=G \\frac{(NIR−Red)}{(NIR+C1⋅Red−C2⋅Blue+L)}\\)\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(EVI = 2.5 * \\frac{Band5 - Band4}{Band5 + 6* Band4 - 7.5*Band2 + 1}\\)\n\nNDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) was formulated for the detection of liquid water and moisture content of vegetation and soil.(Gao 1996)\n\n\\(NDWI_{veg​}= \\frac{(NIR+Green)}{(NIR−Green)}\\)\nIn Landsat 8-9: \\(NDWI = \\frac{Band4-Band2}{Band4+band2}\\)\n\n\nThese indicators, are sufficient only for basic analysis demands, to derive more hidden relations, more modern techniques such as deep learning,(Ma et al. 2019) and Semi-supervised representation learning (Yan et al. 2020) can also be employed."
