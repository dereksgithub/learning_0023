# Week 6 Introduction to Google Earth Engine {.unnumbered}

This is a very exciting week that I could not physically attend since I was at the CUSP Data Dive (Datathon), GEE is something that interested me before selecting this module.

## Javascript and GEE

Javascript is the main language used to

tbh kind like Java, this helps in terms of me getting myself familiar with the code.

## GEE Case Study Bristol

### Air Quality

First, I gathered air quality data over Bristol. But the resolution from Sentinel 5P was not ideal, thus I zoomed out in order to find places with high NO2 levels, in the end, even London is included.

### NDVI and NDWI

### Putting Everything Together

I also packed these layers with in [this app](https://ee-mengyu-derek-ding.projects.earthengine.app/view/brsitol-ndvindwiarvisavi-lookup) for Bristol:

Plot time-series for air quality around Bristol

For this week's practical, I continued with Bristol.

This is what I used to add legend, I have hence modified it and made it into a dedicated

``` js
// set position of panel for ndvi:
var legend = ui.Panel({
style: {
position: 'bottom-left',
padding: '8px 15px'
}
});

// Create legend title
var legendTitle = ui.Label({
value: 'NDVI',
style: {
fontWeight: 'bold',
fontSize: '18px',
margin: '0 0 4px 0',
padding: '0'
}
});

// Add the title to the panel
legend.add(legendTitle);

// create vizualization parameters
//var viz = {min:0, max:3500, palette:['ffffff','b7f0ae','21f600','0000FF','FDFF92','FF2700','d600ff']};

// create the legend image
var lon = ee.Image.pixelLonLat().select('latitude');
var gradient = lon.multiply((ndviVis.max-ndviVis.min)/100.0).add(ndviVis.min);
var legendImage = gradient.visualize(ndviVis);

// create text on top of legend
var panel = ui.Panel({
widgets: [
ui.Label(ndviVis['max'])
],
});
 
legend.add(panel);

// create thumbnail from the image
var thumbnail = ui.Thumbnail({
image: legendImage,
params: {bbox:'0,0,10,100', dimensions:'10x200'},
style: {padding: '1px', position: 'bottom-center'}
});
 
// add the thumbnail to the legend
legend.add(thumbnail);
 
// create text on top of legend
var panel = ui.Panel({
widgets: [
ui.Label(ndviVis['min'])
],
});
 
legend.add(panel);
 
Map.add(legend);
```

Derived from: [Open Geo Blog](https://mygeoblog.com/2016/12/09/add-a-legend-to-to-your-gee-map/).

I used created the following colour code gradients for the four metrics from this [website](https://www.color-hex.com/).

``` js
// NDVI visualization parameters
var ndviVis = {
  min: -1, // Adjust the minimum NDVI value as needed
  max: 1,  // Adjust the maximum NDVI value as needed
  //palette: ['ffffff', 'e6fdec', 'cefcda',  'b5fbc7', '9dfab5', '85f9a2', '6cf890', '54f77d', '3bf66a', '23f558', '0bf446']
  palette: ['ffffff','e5f5e9','ccecd4','b3e2bf','9ad9aa','81d095','68c67f','4fbd6a','36b355','1daa40','04a12b']
};
```

A couple of paragraphs on each classification method.

## Reflection

Employing Google Earth Engine (GEE) certainly rekindles memories of my extensive collaborative efforts on diverse projects in Melbourne. During those projects, I relied on Nearmaps to corrdinate with the design team and worked closely alongside engineers and GIS specialists. Together, we organised design modifications and championed the digital transformation of urban planning processes. Unlike those days when my role was more supervisory and collaborative, I now find myself directly engaged with GEE, utilizing its powerful remote sensing capabilities for urban analysis and environmental applications.
