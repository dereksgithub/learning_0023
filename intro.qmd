# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Hi, welcome to my CASA0023 Learning Diary. A bit about myself:

I am an engineer by training. Graduated from University of Alberta in 2015 with a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering. Been working in the ITS(Intelligent Transportation Systems) industry since. I've also got a Master of Information Technology from Monash University in 2019. Working as a graduate engineer in Melbourne for a few years and then product/solutions manager in the autonomous driving and smart cities industry.

I am interested in transportation and urban evolution mostly. My career will be focusing on urban mobility and smart transportation from this degree on.

Besides working on transportation challenges, I like to imagine how technology will evolve with us, humanity, into the future. Read and watched quite a few science fictions and learning about random subjects. For example, I was into hand-made Corsi-Rosenthal boxes during 2021 and 2022.

I also likes to code. Here is the link to my side projects hosted on github:
