# Week 9 Synthetic Aperture Radar {.unnumbered}

This week we covered the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and application of SAR data. SAR employs radar to create images of the Earth's surface which makes it an active sensor.

## Introduction to SAR

SAR is a powerful remote sensing method for gathering high-resolution images of the Earth's surface. With its active nature, the SAR can penetrate the could and weather conditions yielding highly accurate surface texture data.

can collect data using different polarization.

Longer Apertures = Finer Resolution

## Practical: Running SAR Analysis

Using Ollie's code for Blast Damage Assessment, I was able to assess the 2019 [Xiangshui Chemical Plant Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Xiangshui_chemical_plant_explosion) which happened in Jiangsu Province, China.

There is no open-building-footprint datasets that is freely available via GEE, I will be searching for available data to perform more detailed reports later on.

The results are published in a GEE App, with layer of 2018 and 2022 Sentinel Images of the explosion site.
