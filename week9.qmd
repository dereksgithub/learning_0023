# Week 9 Synthetic Aperture Radar {.unnumbered}

This week we covered the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and application of SAR data. SAR employs radar to create images of the Earth's surface which makes it an active sensor.

## Introduction to SAR

SAR is a powerful remote sensing method for gathering high-resolution images of the Earth's surface.

This charac

can collect data using different polarization.
