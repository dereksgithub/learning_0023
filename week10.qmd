# Week 10 Group Presentations {.unnumbered}

This week we had two intense sessions packed with interesting remote sensing pitch-style presentations. The following is a [Google Earth Engine App](https://ee-derekding727.projects.earthengine.app/view/jakartabuidlingandndvilookup) that I have made for viewing parts of the intended raw data for our pitch. The app may take a while to load as the Google Open Buildings dataset is large.

Our team's name is developed from Roman Goddess of Flowers and Olympian Goddess of the harvest and agriculture. The slides are [here](https://dereksgithub.github.io/group_RS_casa0023/).

We are honored to be invited to ask question for TeamXYZ and their pitch on an Air Pollution management solution-suite designed for Mumbai. We asked about their future plans and the reply was solid and informative, their overall design and open approach to stakeholder engagement plans are quite impressive.
