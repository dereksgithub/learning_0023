## HTML, CSS and Quarto

Here are a list of resources that I have used and adapted for this Quarto book:

-   [Embedding videos](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html)

## Future Works

The trend now seems to be building application with Python + GEE, therefore, I am planning to use the Python / GEE tool suite for parts of the visualization work with thesis work. Hopefully it will be interactive and with a touch of satellite images showing the road networks for the transport in a city.
