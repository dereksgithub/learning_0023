The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) outline numerous objectives for urban and built environments. Recently, mountain and bush fires have significantly deteriorated the air quality in major parts of the world, to make the matters worse, the smogs can travel far from time to time, threatening the health and quality of life for a great many residents.\n\nConsequently, my case study, centred around Melbourne and its adjacent suburbs, aims to explore the integration of remote sensing for wildfire monitoring with urban air quality forecasting. This short study intends identify the potentials of integrating remote sensing into the current pipelines, thus provide policymakers and city councils with sufficient lead time to implement measures before smog affects residential areas. Potential policy integration could include distribution of air filtration systems, masks or the evacuation of affected populations. This pilot study seeks to investigate the policy ramifications of establishing such operational frameworks.\n\n## Wildfire Monitoring for Air Quality with Remote Sensing\n\n#### Case Study and Policy Implications for the Greater Melbourne Area\n\nThe goal for this short study is to explore the forecasting of bush-fire air pollution to areas that may impact the residents and discuss policy implications. Focusing on Melbourne, with framework that includes remote sensing, intended to be integrated with sustainable future planning inspired the use of remote sensing for monitoring urban growth in Perth, WA. [@maclachlan2017urban]\n\nAs for the imagery, Sentinel 5P from Copernicus Program is offering sufficient resolutions. In terms of spatial resolution it covers up to a 5.5km x 3.5km area, Sentinel 5P also offers a daily global coverage, (revisits less than one day) providing enough temporal resolution. As for spectral resolution, Sentinel 5P offers accurate quantification of various atmospheric gases and pollutants including carbon monoxide(CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone(O3), formaldehyde(HCHO), sulfur dioxide(SO2), methane(CH4) and aerosols thanks to its extensive spectral coverage which includes UV, VIS and NIR bands.[@sentinel] It also possesses radiometric resolution at satisfactory level which enables the sensors on-board to distinguish different levels of signal intensity. The following is a video summary of the 2019 to 2020 bushfire air pollutant spread in Australia which resulted in low AQI in a great portion of the country's residential areas not to mention destruction of many homes.

Using remote sensing for monitoring wild fire monitoring has long been proposed for Eastern Australia. [@milne1986use]\n\nBy extracting values from the daily Sentinel 5p data, we can monitor the wildfire and combine the ground weather/air quality monitoring data, to determine how the polluted air will impact the densely populated area (mapping the air monitoring data over the building footprint [in Australia](https://github.com/microsoft/AustraliaBuildingFootprints)) thus, provide intervention implications for distributing devices and masks. In the literature, similar was workflow proposed for monitoring wild fires in the US.

residential AQI can be dramatically affected by wildfires, therefore, it is crucial to have a integrated pipeline for the monitoring of harmful aerosol spike which is also incorporated into the policy stack and is dedicated with ample resources.\n\n![Sentinel 5P image Overlay with Map around (well, again, \"around\" and covering VIC and NSW) Melbourne (Time window set to December 01, 2019 to
