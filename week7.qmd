# Week 7 Classification with Google Earth Engine I {.unnumbered}

For this week's diary, find studies that use GEE with classification

Existing study using classification GEE, critique/pros/cons

note down some of the classifiers, and describe in your own words.

Summarize how I would like to use for other research

Your own case not the focus,

theory extension / literature

A couple of paragraphs on each classification method.

RF – Boosting — CNN

1.     Add more Critiques to the literature you reviewed, extend the current research.

2.     Structure the contents better, give a clear architecture on the right sides of the webpage.

## Classification Methods in Remote Sensing

In the context of remote sensing, there are several classification methods, ranging from logistic regression to
