# Week 3 Corrections {.unnumbered}

This week we covered the corrections

## Case Study of Bristol - Continued

This week's topic is on correction, the author carried on with the Bristol study as Bristol area happens to have overlap of Landsat 8 and 9.

Landsat 8 image corrected (Dark Object Substration method) with adjusted reflectance values that account for atmospheric effects, leading to a more accurate image.

This is an interesting concept since it is very interesting to explore the concept of this and that.

## Reflection

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a remote sensing index that measures the health and density of vegetation on the Earth's surface. NIR represents the near-infrared light reflected by vegetation, and RED represents the visible red light reflected by vegetation.

$NDVI = \frac{(NIR - RED)}{(NIR+RED)}$

The technical part for this week's practical is relatively simple, however the data collection and alignment do consume a lot of time. I also spent too much time trying to overlay the Landsat data to shapefile as the CRS was not consistent.
